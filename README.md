### b) Title of the project: Zouk Cafe Website

### c) Introduction
Zouk has been in a Cafe in IIUM for a few years already. Yet, the cafe is always full of customers, especially at peak hour. The arabic based food pulls so many customers throughout the day. So our group will make a website to help the cafe to organise customers more efficiently. Otherwise, the customers need to make a very long line in front of the cafe.





### d) Objective
Our objectives are to make a database management suitable for dining places. We also want to make a website that is easy to manage and not too complicated. Next, the website should be able to make a booking place for dine-in beforehand. Lastly, the website will display the currently available menu as they are available at the cafe.

### e) Features and functionalities
To make sure that their customers will not wait too long in front of the cafe on our websites, there will be a lot of features and functionality. We will make a booking system for dine-in customers so all customers need to make a booking before coming if they do not want to wait for other customers to finish their food. There will also be a menu page for customers easily planning their menu or they can order directly while they booking a place or . Customers will create an account for them to have access to all the features above.
